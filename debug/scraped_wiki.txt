MAIN CONTENT:
PowerShell includes its own extensive, console-based help (similar to man pages in Unix shells ) accessible via the Get-Help cmdlet. Updated local help contents can be retrieved from the Internet via the Update-Help cmdlet. Alternatively, help from the web can be acquired on a case-by-case basis via the -online switch to Get-Help .

Shell programs, including PowerShell, trace lineage to shells in older operating systems such as MS-DOS and Xenix which exposed system functionality to the user almost exclusively via a command-line interface (CLI) – although MS-DOS 5 also came with a complementary graphical DOS Shell . The Windows 9x family came bundled with COMMAND.COM , the command-line environment of MS-DOS. The Windows NT and Windows CE families, however, came with the newer cmd.exe – a significant upgrade from COMMAND.COM. Both environments provide CLI for both internal and external commands and automation via batch files – a relatively primitive language for scripting.

To address limitations of these shells – including the inability to directly use a software component exposed via COM – Microsoft introduced the Windows Script Host in 1998 with Windows 98 , and its command-line based host, cscript.exe . It integrates with the Active Script engine and allows scripts to be written in compatible languages, such as JScript and VBScript . These scripts can use COM components directly, but it has relatively inaccessible documentation and gained a reputation as a system vulnerability vector after several high-profile computer viruses exploited weaknesses in its security provisions.

Monad was to be a new extensible CLI with a fresh design capable of automating a range of core administrative tasks. Microsoft first demonstrated Monad publicly at the Professional Development Conference in Los Angeles in October 2003. A few months later, they opened up private beta, which eventually led to a public beta. Microsoft published the first Monad public beta release on June 17, 2005, and the Beta 2 on September 11, 2005, and Beta 3 on January 10, 2006.

A cmdlet can be added to the shell via modules or before v2 snap-ins. Users are not limited to the cmdlets included in the base PowerShell installation.

The number of cmdlets included in the base PowerShell install for various versions:

Upon running a configuration , DSC will ensure that the system gets the state described in the configuration. DSC configurations are idempotent. The Local Configuration Manager (LCM) periodically polls the system using the control flow described by resources (imperative pieces of DSC) to make sure that the state of a configuration is maintained.

Initially using the code name "Monad", PowerShell was first shown publicly at the Professional Developers Conference in October 2003 in Los Angeles.

New features include:

Key features included:

The following table contains various cmdlets that ship with PowerShell that have notably similar functionality to commands in other shells. Many of these cmdlets are exposed to the user via predefined aliases to make their use familiar to users of the other shells.
